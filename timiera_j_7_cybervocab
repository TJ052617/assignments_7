Phishing is usually through email to retain Personal Information(PII). Phishing emails look like a known organization trying to get 
Personal Information from someone. Anyone can Phish anyone's email to get personal information like, social security number(SSN), passwords.
My friend Michael was unaware of someone even thinking about hacking him. He got an email from google about his account being closed
unless he went to the link below and changed it. He thought it was real because it was an "email" from Google and since Google was
well-known he believed it and got hacked.
